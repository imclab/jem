Jem  
==============================================================================

**What’s all this, then?**
It’s but a sketch! A work in progress! And perhaps someday I’ll even get 
around to completing the example bits—but there’s enough here already to 
demonstrate where my mind’s at, eh?

**Who’s the audience for this? No, I mean really—who?**
Jem is for JavaScript enthusiasts who enjoy lightweight solutions for building
small websites like art portfolios, personal blogs, and so on. Jem pushes 
all of the other common web languages out of the way—like HTML, CSS, database 
query languages and so on—in favor of good old JavaScript. Isn’t that nice?

**How can I try it out?**
Just drag and drop the index.html file into your browser window. Jem is built
to run the same off a desktop as it does off a server. This makes testing and 
sketching out changes to your site very convenient. No server software to 
install and confgure on your local machine. No pre-processors like Sass or 
CoffeeScript to fiddle with. 

**But where’s the database?**
Your data is sorted right in the JavaScript code itself. If you were running a
social network with a billion users that would be ridiculous. But if it’s a 
portfolio site with a few dozen projects, a few hundred blog posts, and so on, 
then it’s actually a fresh way to look at the problem. JavaScript Objects are 
happy to store data of any type and Arrays of Objects can be easily sorted and
filtered—just like querying a regular database. 

**This doesn’t sound very scalable**
It’s not! And it’s not pretending to be either. That’s its charm.

**What if my site outgrows Jem? Is my data locked in?**
Jem can export your data to CSV and MySQL so it’s easy to take your data with 
you. Plus, because all of that export code is right there in plain JavaScript 
you can customize it if needed. 

**How are Jem’s files organized?**
Most frameworks separate server-side executables from static assets from 
client-sides scripts from stylesheets, etc. Jem instead groups files according
to context. Blog-related files go in the blog folder—period. This makes it 
easy to swap a new portfolio project in (or out) for example.

**What about access priviledges? What if I’ve got an intern updating my blog 
but I don’t want to give her access to the whole site?**
Just give her FTP access to the /blog/ folder. Everything’s encapsulated, 
right? So she’ll only have access to what she needs and nothing more!

**What about password protection? Let’s say you have a directory you only wish
a specific client to have access to?**
Just encrypt the objects! Use their email address and password as the key to 
discourage them from sharing it around. 

**If there’s no server-side component how do I track usage?**
Just use a free analytics service—like most sane people do. Jem can play nice
with Google Analytics; right now that requires some doin’ on your end, but 
more emphatic support for this is coming. 

**Are you concerned that search engines might not be able to index your site’s
content on account that it’s entirely dynamically generated?**
Nope.

**Couldn’t you at least use JSON data instead of raw JavaScript for storing
data? That way you could—**
Nope. It needed to be executable. Besides, JSON is just half-neutered 
JavaScript anyway.



File organization
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TBD. Still working out the manifesto and implementation for this...




Road map
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Downwind search**. Right now the blog example is super boring because it 
can’t traverse the folder structure and pull out data from different blog
posts. That’s a serious problem! Don’t worry, it’s the first thing on the 
list—Jem would be pretty silly without it.

**Pjax-style navigation**. Jem is ripe for lazy loading and the elemination of
full page requests. But we’re just not there yet. (No time yet!)

**Clearer support for Google Analytics**. It’s already possible to use Google
Analytics or similar tracking software, but it would be nice to make it 
clearer how to configure that for Pjax-style navigation.

**Scheme**. Jem wrangles HTML and CSS via JavaScript. And we’re already 
massaging those naming conventions. This puts us just a step away from 
crafting an entirely different language. Lisp is beautiful. JavaScript is 
already based on Scheme. Why not add a Scheme interpreter so you can then 
write your whole Jem-based website just using Scheme?!




Code typography
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

__Semicolons__  
First, I only use semicolons when absolutely necessary. By definition any
valid JavaScript interpreter _must_ perform automatic semicolon insertion. 
This means you just don’t need them. Let me repeat: YOU JUST DON’T NEED THEM.
Leaving them out makes your code typographically cleaner; reduces visual 
clutter and noise in the signal. It’s good for your soul.

__Whitespace__  
I use tabs, not spaces for codeblock indentation—functions, object blocks, and
so on. Tab is the only true unit of indentation. My tabs are the width of four
spaces. Two is too small. Eight is just too damn wide. Within lines of code 
I’ll often add bits of whitespace to line up consecutive equal signs or other
recurring symbols if it’s subtle and not too wonky:
```  
right = 2  
left  = 3  
```  

I’ll often add a space between an open-parenthesis and a token; same for 
between a token and close-parenthesis. Line breaks after an open bracket are
also desirable. 

__Comments__  
Two line breaks before line comments. One line break after them. Two spaces 
following a comment’s slashes. (One for hanging quotation marks in order to
optically align the text itself.) For critical to-do’s I add two juxtaposed
ampersats to both visually separate them and make them easy to search for. 
Just a quirk of mine. Occasionally if the situation calls for it I’ll use 
special “rhombus” commnents for big visual breaks. They have three horizontal 
spaces between slashes and text and vertical padding inside like so:  
```  
    /////////////////  
   //             //  
  //   Rhombus   //  
 //             //  
/////////////////  
```  
I pad these rhombus comments with four line breaks above and two below.
